## Q & A
* Q: Are there any issues creating a stored procedure from PHP code?
* A: YES!  See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11300595/the-mysql-delimiter-keyword-isnt-working
    * Commands between the `BEGIN` and `END` block of the stored procedure creation code need to have the delimiter `;`
    * The shell command `DELIMITER` which is used to change the delimiter, is *not part of SQL*!
    * PDO will not send an SQL statement which contains `DELIMITER`: you will get a fatal error
    * The best approach is to create the stored procedure as a database administrator (DBA)
    * Alternatively ... and this is an *extremely* poor substitute, you can issue a _command shell_ command as follows:
```
shell_exec('mysql -u vagrant -pvagrant -e "DELIMITER #"');
```
    * You can then use PDO to send the commands to build the stored procedure
```
$pdo->exec($stored);
```
    * Afterwards, shell out to reset the delimiter:
```
shell_exec('mysql -u vagrant -vagrant -e "DELIMITER ;"');
```

* Q: What's a good quick way to learn about the Domain Model?
* A: See: https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly

* Q: How long are traditional RDBMS databases going to be around?
* A: See: https://db-engines.com/en/ranking

* Q: major diffs between PSR-0 and PSR-4?
* A: PSR-4 has the following differences:
    * Main difference: *less restrictive*
    * got rid of the "requirement" that the top-level of a namespace must be the "vendor" name
    * underscores (_) have no special meaning
    * removed implementation details/requirements: leaves that up to you

* Q: do you have an example of plugin manager functionality using __call()?
* A: you could implement an array of callbacks which could be consulted by __call()

* Q: Is there documentation on the effort to make __construct() method failures consistent by throwing Exceptions?
* A: See: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/internal_constructor_behaviour

* Q: Is `realPath()` useful or recommended?
* A: Yes: example from OrderApp:
```
// function to ensure path exists
function reallyRealPath($path)
{
	if ($newPath = realpath($path)) {
		return $newPath;
	} else {
		throw new RuntimeException('Base path undefined');
	}
}

define('BASE', reallyRealPath(__DIR__ . '/../'));
```

## CLASS NOTES
* Magic Methods: https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php
* Really cool function: `array_column()` : also works for arrays of objects
* Abstract Class / Interface Examples:
    * https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros
        * implementation of PSR-7 interfaces
    * https://github.com/dbierer/oauth.unlikelysource.org/blob/master/module/AuthOauth/src/AuthOauth/Adapter/BaseAdapter.php
        * NOTE: need to add `authenticate()` as an abstract method as it's mandatory
* Traits example: https://github.com/dbierer/classic_php_examples/blob/master/oop/trait_insteadof_example.php
* Other PDO examples: https://github.com/dbierer/classic_php_examples/tree/master/db
* Excellent 3rd party library for mail: PHP Mailer
    * https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer
    * SMTP example: https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/smtp.phps
* Example of preg_replace_callback_array()
    * https://github.com/dbierer/php7cookbook/blob/master/source/Application/Parse/Convert.php
* How to get PDO Sqlite to work in VM:
    * sudo pecl install pdo_sqlite worked ... but the build failed: not the current version
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22551971/failed-to-install-pdo
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8822209/pdo-sqlite-driver-not-present-what-to-do
    * Installed with `apt-get` using exact version of PHP
```
sudo apt-get install php7.2-sqlite
```
* Documentation from doc blocks

## ERRATA
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/2/12: last bullet: underscores: not true
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/2/46: not necessarily! i.e. look at Zend\Diactoros as an example; otherwise, just use an interface
* General: OOP section: Need to discuss `__invoke()`!!!
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/2/73: there are more than 2!!!
* OrderApp: dates are not formatted properly!
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/4/25: remove the `execute()` statement!
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/6/3: can also use [] as delimiters
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/6/14: need to mention imprecise quantifiers (*+?)
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/9/4: this doesn't work: need to use namespace syntax!
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/9/7: validation example
