# PHP-II Jan 2019

## Homework
* For Wed 9 Jan 2019
  * Lab: Namespace
  * Lab: Create a Class
## Q & A
* Q: major diffs between PSR-0 and PSR-4?
* A: PSR-4 has the following differences:
    * Main difference: *less restrictive*
    * got rid of the "requirement" that the top-level of a namespace must be the "vendor" name
    * underscores (_) have no special meaning
    * removed implementation details/requirements: leaves that up to you

## CLASS NOTES
* Magic Methods: https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php
* Really cool function: `array_column()` : also works for arrays of objects

## ERRATA
* file:///D:/Repos/PHP-Fundamentals-II/Course_Materials/index.html#/2/12: last bullet: underscores: not true
